### Problem 


**a. Define the decision variables**

The decision variables  = Number of units of the new product produced on each plant(regardless of its size) 


  $X_i$ = means the number of units produced on each plant, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 
3).

    L, M, and S = means the product's size, where L = large, M = medium, and S = small.

    $X_iL$ = number of large items produced on plant $i$, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 3).

    $X_iM$ = number of medium items produced on plant $i$, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 3).

    $X_iS$ = number of small items produced on plant $i$, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 3).



**b. Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.**

Let 

    $X_iL$ = number of large items produced on plant $i$, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 3).

    $X_iM$ = number of medium items produced on plant $i$, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 3).

    $X_iS$ = number of small items produced on on plant $i$, where $i$= 1 (Plant 1), 2 (Plant 2), and 3 (Plant 3).


Maximize profit 

    $Z= 420 \ (X_1L + X_2L + X_3L) + 360 \ (X_1M + X_2M + X_3M) + 300 / (X_1S + X_2S + X_3S)$


Constraints:

  Total number of sizeâ€™s units produced regardless the plant:

    $L = X_1L + X_2L + X_3L$

    $M = X_1M + X_2M + X_3M$

    $S = X_1S + X_2S + X_3S$

  Production capacity per unit by plant each day:

    Plant 1 = $X_1L + X_1M + X_1S \ 750$

    Plant 2 = $X_2L + X_2M + X_2S \ 900$

    Plant 3 = $X_3L + X_3M + X_3S \ 450$

  Storage capacity per unit by plant each day:

    Plant 1 = $20 X_1L + 15 X_1M + 12 X_1S \13000$

    Plant 2 = $20 X_2L + 15 X_2M + 12 X_2S \ 12000$

    Plant 3 = $20 X_3L + 15 X_3M + 12 X_3S \ 5000$

  Sales forecast per day:

    $L = X_1L + X_2L + X_3L \ 900$

    $M = X_1M + X_2M + X_3M \ 1200$

    $S = X_1S + X_2S + X_3S \ 750$

  The plants should use the same percentage of their excess capacity to produce the new product. 


    $\dfrac {X_1L + X_1M + X_1S} {750}$ = $\dfrac {X_2L + X_2M + X_2S} {900}$ = $\dfrac {X_3L + X_3M + X_3S} {450}$


      It can be simplified as:

          a) $900 (X_1L + X_1M + X_1S) - 750 (X_2L + X_2M + X_2S) = 0$

          b) $450 (X_2L + X_2M + X_2S) - 900 (X_3L + X_3M + X_3S) = 0$

          c) $450 (X_1L + X_1M + X_1S) - 750 (X_3L + X_3M + X_3S) = 0$

  All values must be greater or equal to zero

    $L, M,$ and $S \ 0$

    $X_iL, X_iM,$ and $X_iS \ 0$
